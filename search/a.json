It is likely that some random environmental frequencies may be able to rattle around melanosomes and melanocytes causing minute, undetectable changes. The most common natural causes for visible changes in eye color are hormonal changes/aging, genetics, and trauma.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">As far as using sound frequencies to significantly altar iris pigmentation via medical treatment, there is no direct research. However, there are some techniques that may be plausible candidates if applied correctly. Its important to note that in order for sound to permanently change eye color, it must eliminate melanocytes. This is because adult melanocytes still undergo melanogenesis and would replace lost melanin. So, as far as permanent changes go, one can perform a localized tissue destruction with ultrasound. However, this would probably be less accurate than the current laser approach. For temporary changes, there has been some research on degradation of melanin, though they are typically under alkaline or unsafe temperatures.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">So what is left for sound in altering eye color? Assisted delivery of pigments and plasmids. The following patent: <span class=\"qlink_container\"><a class=\"external_link\" data-qt-tooltip=\"google.com\" href=\"http://www.google.com/patents/US20090192438\" onclick=\"return Q.openUrl(this, 17596088);\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Patent US20090192438 - Use of Iontophoresis or Electrotherapy and Ultrasound to Deliver Melanin for Skin Rejuvenation</a></span>, uses ultrasound to assist in pigment delivery. This could potentially be applied to the iris, ultrasound has been used for targeted drug delivery before. It is also possible that microbubbles could be used to deliver a plasmid or pigment to the iris, similar to this: <span class=\"qlink_container\"><a class=\"external_link\" data-qt-tooltip=\"sciencedirect.com\" href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365911006067\" onclick=\"return Q.openUrl(this, 17596088);\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ultrasound and microbubble-assisted gene delivery in Achilles tendons: Long lasting gene expression and restoration of fibromodulin KO phenotype</a></span>. However, there is the potential that these frequencies would be damaging to the rest of the eye.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">Over all, I feel there are more practical ways of altering eye color, such as laser treatment and viral gene delivery (<span class=\"qlink_container\"><a class=\"external_link\" data-qt-tooltip=\"nih.gov\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189008/\" onclick=\"return Q.openUrl(this, 17596088);\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Page on nih.gov</a></span>).

In addition to her points, epigenetics can play a major role in how your traits will be expressed in your child. </p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">Epigenetics is a rapidly growing feild. It is essentially the study of inheritable information that is not DNA. This mostly includes methylation of nucleotides and the methylation/acetylation of histones. What they both have in common is changing how difficult it is to read a particular gene. The harder it is to read the less it is expressed, vise versa. These changes are inherited but can sometimes be altered by extreme or timely environmental conditions. </p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">There has been increasing evidence that your diet and fitness can influence the metabolism of your children.

For example you can use CRISPR Cas9 or harmless/non replicating viruses. You can target a parents egg cells or spermatozoa/primordial germ cells. However, the method that is more likely is altering ones embryos. Human embryos have been successfully modified with the insertion of a GFP gene by researchers at Cornell. The embryo was then destroyed as governed. To my knowledge this was the first time a human embryo was genetically modified and I am in aware of any developments since. Because the gene is fully incorporated into the embryo, all of its cells there on will contain the inserted gene, which includes it's germ cells. As such, it is an inheritable gene insertion.</span>"

SketchUp and Autodesk products are a good place to start as they have lots of documentation and easy UI.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\"><b>Option 2</b> - Find a modeler: there are many 3D object banks, you can find and contact people who have uploaded objects of similar design or complexity. Ask some people for some quotes and find the best price. As long as its not artistic or overly complex, it shouldn\u2019t really matter who you choose. (This is why many include contacts and websites)</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">Option 3 - Find a design company: They are out there in various sizes. However, I am sure its not cheap as you are competing against companies that outsource design (both artistic and technical).</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">Option 4 - Engineering consultant: I assume you are a hobbyist, so this would be overkill. However, I don\u2019t want to make assumptions. Depending on the firm you use, they can help you outsource and manage the design of your \u201cstuff\u201d.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para\">Final thoughts: If you are not in a rush, go with Option 1 as it will serve you well in the future. Option 2 if your a hobbyist in a rush. Option 3/4 if you are in a rush to get something complex done. As for printing, there are hubs. That is all anyone has mentioned so far, so I\u2019m sure your well informed by now.</p></span>"
